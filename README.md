PPM (PPM project mangement) is a single user project, task, and time management system. 

It has the following features:

- Mobile and desktop friendly
- Fast: 100 lighthouse score

Made so that you can see what you spend your spare time on. 

# Usage

You can try it or use it on https://ppm.10kilobyte.com/account

It only works with `await / async` and some other 'modern' features enabled in the browser. 

There is no transpiling of the javascript. 

If you have updated you browser the last couple of years you will be good to go. 

# Install

Known to work on:  `PHP >= 7.4.3`

Clone the source code: 

    git clone https://github.com/diversen/ppm-project-manager

Install composer packages:

    cd ppm-project-manager && composer install

## Create a MySQL database

You will need some kind of database. I use MySQL, but maybe it will work with other databases as well. 

You don't have to use docker - this is just for ease of setup if you don't have a database server. 

Using docker for the database:

Install (run) a MySQL image that will work:

    docker run -p 3306:3306 --name mysql-server -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -d mysql:5.7

Connect using bash and create a database:

    docker exec -it mysql-server bash
    mysql -uroot -ppassword
    create database ppm;
    exit; # exit from mysql-server 
    exit; # exit from container

Load SQL:

    docker exec -i mysql-server mysql -uroot -ppassword ppm  < ./sql/mysql.sql 

The above setup corresponds with the default `config/DB.php`. If you have altered the database name or the server user or the server password, you will need to edit it in this file. 

## Configuration

You should create a `config-locale` dir which you can make different from machine to machine. 

The `config-locale` dir will override settings in `config`.

    mkdir config-locale

You can look at the other `config/` files, but you don't need to change these in order to run the system local now: 

    ./serv

The above command runs the built-in PHP server.

## Login

Point a browser to http://localhost:8000, create an account and log in.

In the folder `config-locale` you can add any locale configuration the will override settings in `config`. 

Using SMTP for email confirmation:

* Remove `no_email_verify` in `Config/Account.php` or set it to false. 
* Edit the `SMTP` configuration in `config/SMTP.php`. 

Google login using OAuth:

* Setup google OAuth in `config/Google.php`.

## Other useful docker commands

List conainers 

    docker container ls

Stop container (mysql-server):

    docker stop mysql-server

Start container (mysql-server) again:

    docker start mysql-server

Remove container (you will need run 'run' command again):

    docker rm mysql-server
